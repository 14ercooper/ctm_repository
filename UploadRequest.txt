Hello <name here>,

I am creating a repository of CTM maps a https://ctmrepository.com to help keep maps from getting lost from file share services shutting down, Forums closing threads, and just general link rot.
I noticed that you've created some CTM maps, namely <maps>, and would like to request permission to include them in the repository. As a bonus of your maps being in the repository, they will be archived for posterity as well as recieving a free direct download link free of advertisements like those on Mediafire.
Note that I make no profit from the repository, it only serves to archive CTM maps for posterity along with making them easier to find (as they are all in one place).

If you grant me permission to put your maps on the repository, no further action will be required on your part. I'll locate copies of the maps as well as all needed information and place them on the repository.
If you don't want your maps in the repository, just let me know. You will recieve no further requests from me.

Thanks,
